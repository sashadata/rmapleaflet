First map

```{r }
library(zipcode)
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(readr)

data("zipcode")
zipcode_ma <-zipcode %>% 
  filter(state =="MA")

income<-read.csv("MA.csv")
third<-second<-merge.data.frame(income, zipcode_ma, by="city")
third<-third %>% 
  filter(Median.Household.Income >= 50000 & Median.Household.Income <= 70000)

third <-third[!duplicated(third$city),]


m<-leaflet(data = third) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(label = ~city) 


```

## Map

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
m
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
